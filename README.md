# Gesture Control Snake Game

This is a Python snake game that can be controlled using hand gestures captured from the camera. The game uses the OpenCV and Pygame libraries for camera input and game rendering, and the Mediapipe library for hand tracking.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   OpenCV
-   Pygame
-   Mediapipe

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: gh repo clone BadagalaAdarsh/GestureControlSnakeGame

2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the Python script: python app.py

2. The game window will open, and the camera will start capturing hand gestures.

3. Use your hand gestures to control the snake's movement. Refer to the on-screen instructions for gesture mappings.

4. Eat the green food to grow the snake and increase your score. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body

5. Press 'q' to quit the game.
